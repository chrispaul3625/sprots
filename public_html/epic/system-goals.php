			<h1> System Goals</h1>
			<p> The goals of our project will be for a user to access our website and quickly be able to find information about teams and players within major league sports teams in the US such as EPL, NFL, NBA, and MLB. Our system will allow users to create a profile and have the option to save "favorite" teams to their profile for easy quick access to stats about their favorite teams. Our system will be able to provide users access to stats about teams, and individual players as well. Our system will also allow for push notifications to be sent to a user to alert them about game times and scores.</p>
