			Conceptual Model for Sprots
		</h1>
		<p>
			Sprots is going to be designed to give the team and individual players stats for these four professional teams NFL, NBA, MLB, and MLS.
		</p>
		<p>
			The conceptual design is going to be one that will essentially reference outside libraries for the data, but provide it in a clear, easily searchable format.
		</p>
		<p>
			To start, we'd like to make the searchable information absolutely free, to anyone. Going forward, and if plausible, We would like to implement a "push notification" style system.
