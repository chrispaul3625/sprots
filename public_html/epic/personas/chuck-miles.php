		<h2>Chuck Miles</h2>
		<p>
			Chuck Miles is an average guy who is just getting into playing fantasy football with his coworkers. Chuck is
			38 years old and hasn't really ever gotten into sports much. Chuck decides to get online and needs a place in which
			he can review player stats, check out team information and also be able to save these teams to a profile so he can
			easily monitor his teams and access player stats as well. Chuck primarily will be using his Iphon 6s to check
			these things.
